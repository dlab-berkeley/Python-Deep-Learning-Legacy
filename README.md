# Deep Learning in Python

This is the repository for D-Lab’s six-hour Introduction to Deep Learning in Python workshop. [View the associated slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NQBDrjkM5ZdabDQFxd5_EqjXA33gt9N0-uI9viVTs6A/edit?usp=sharing).

## Objectives

Convey the basics of deep learning in Python using keras on image datasets. Students are empowered with a general grasp of deep learning, example code that they can modify, a working computational environment, and resources for further study.

## Content outline

* Installation
  * Jupyter Notbook
  * Keras and Tensorflow
  * Helper packages
* What is “deep” learning? 
* Understanding the dataset
* Dataset splitting: training, test, cross-validation
  * Defining moving parts of a deep learning model 
  * Understanding a loss function, activation function, and metrics
  * Performance evaluation
* Part 1
  * MNIST 0-9 hand-written digit example 
  * Feed Foward (Vanilla) Neural Networks
* Part 2
  * CIFAR10 - 10 image type classification
  * Convolutional Neural Networks

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced level workshop. Participants should be intermediate R users and have had some prior exposure to machine learning.

We assume the following background:

* D-Lab's [Python Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals) (6 hours) 
* Or, comparable experience/training, assuming familiarity with:
  * Basic Python syntax
  * statistical concepts such as mean and standard deviation
  * Train/test splitting and cross-validation
  * Dataset cleaning
  * Overfitting / underfitting
  * Hyperparameter customization

If you are not comfortable installing packages, writing your own Python code, and using Jupyter Notebooks, this will not be a good workshop for you.


## Getting Started

To get started quickly on the cloud via D-Lab's Datahub, click this link: [![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Deep-Learning&urlpath=tree%2FPython-Deep-Learning%2F&branch=main)

If you would like to install packages locally on your computer, see [the installation instructions](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Deep-Learning/blob/development/installation-instructions.md).

This process can take about 30 minutes, so be sure to try and do this before class!
